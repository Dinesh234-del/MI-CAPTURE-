    <h2>About MI Captures</h2>
    <p><strong>MI Captures</strong> is a personal photography gallery showcasing moments that matter â€” from architecture and nature to nightscapes and temples. Every picture here has a story, emotion, and a memory behind it.</p>

    <p>This project was created as part of a web development internship, to combine my passion for photography with the power of web design. The goal was to create a simple, clean, and visually appealing way to present my work.</p>

    <p><strong>Built with ðŸ’»:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€” fully responsive and styled to highlight the photos themselves.</p>

    <p>If youâ€™re a photo lover too, feel free to explore my captures and connect with me through the contact page!</p>
